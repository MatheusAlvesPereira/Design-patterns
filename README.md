## Introduction
Design patterns are essential concepts in software engineering that improve code organization and readability. This repository contains implementations of various design patterns in PHP, categorized into Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns.

## Installation
To use the code in this repository, you need to have PHP installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/design-patterns-php.git
